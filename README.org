#+title:Grasp

Grasp, short for GRAph Specification Processor, allows you to:

- Specify graphs in a super concise format.
- Output graph structure as JSON.
- Leave formatting (layout, colouring, etc.) to other tools, such as GraphViz.


* Examples

Syntax is inspired by both GraphViz and CYPHER:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a -> b
b -> c; c -> d
d, e, f -> g

1 -succ-> 2

x:A -f-> y:B
y -g:G-> z

src -psc-> output
src_js -babel-> build_js.js
output -webpack-> dist_bundle.js
build_js.js -webpack-> dist_bundle.js
#+END_EXAMPLE
