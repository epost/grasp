#+title:Grasp

Grasp, short for GRAph Specification Processor, allows you to:

- Specify graphs in a super concise format.
- Output graph structure as JSON.
- Leave formatting (layout, colouring, etc.) to other tools, such as GraphViz.


* Examples

Syntax is inspired by both GraphViz and CYPHER:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# concise node and edge syntax

a -> b
b -> c; c -> d
d, e, f -> g

# labeled edges

1 -succ-> 2

# type annotations

x:A -f-> y:B
y -g:G-> z
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Features
- [X] no formatting, only structure
- [X] comma syntax: ~a,b,c -> d, e~

- [X] comments
- [ ] transitive syntax? ~a -> b -> c -> d~
- [ ] allow (back)slash in node / edge labels? (handy for paths and URLs)?
- [ ] quoted node / edge labels?
- [ ] dash as part of identifiers maar dan zonder conflicts or ambiguities
- [ ] question mark as part of identifiers
